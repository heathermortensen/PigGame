Pig is a dice rolling game, also known as Skunk.

### Java version of the dice rolling game = Skunk 
* I first programmed the Skunk game in Java using Eclipse. 
* It produces output to terminal.
* It is located in the [SkunkGame repo](https://github.com/heathermortensen/SkunkGame) of my Github page.
* A detailed description of game implemetation can be found in the README.md file.

### Python version of the dice rolling game = Pig.
* Pig frontend screens (screen1.py and screen2.py) were programmed in PyCharm using Tkinter on Windows.
* The backend will be translated from Java into Python using Spyder IDE shipped with Anaconda on Mac OSX.
