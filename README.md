![Pig face](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heathermortensen/PigGame/master/pigFace.png)

* Pig is a dice rolling game (also known as Skunk).
* Screen #1 allows the user to enter the number of players in the game and their corresponding names.
* Screen #2 allows players to play Pig and displays a scorecard.

### Java version of the dice rolling game = Skunk 
* I first programmed the Skunk game in Java using Eclipse. 
* It produced output to terminal.
* It is located in the [SkunkGame repo](https://github.com/heathermortensen/SkunkGame) of my Github page.
* A detailed game description can be found in the SkunkGame [README.md](https://github.com/heathermortensen/SkunkGame/blob/master/README.md) file.

### Python version of the dice rolling game = Pig.
* Frontend screen designs (screen1.py and screen2.py) were sketchd out in PyCharm using python's Tkinter GUI frameowrk on Windows.
* The backend will be translated from Java into Python using Spyder IDE shipped with Anaconda on Mac OSX.

### Step 1.) Frontend sketch

* I first designed both screens in Tkinter (UI framework inherent to python 3) to sketch out a basic layout for the game (see figures 1 and 2).
* I use the PIL Imaging Libary, which excludes me from using Pillow. (verify this - which did I install? They are mutually exclusive.)

#### File: screen1.py

![Screen #1 on Windows & Mac](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heathermortensen/PigGame/master/screen1BothOS.png)

Figure 1. Screen 1 demonstrates basic button click to display game rules


#### File: screen2.py

![Screen #2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heathermortensen/PigGame/master/screen2.png)

Figure 2. Screen 2 is where players take turns rolling dice and a scorecard will be displayed

### Step 2.) Program frontend functionality

* Having aquainted with Tkinter, I started fresh. 
* I programmed into a blank file containing only necessary widgets required to test UI functions.
* Design elements from screen1.py and screen2.py can be added in quickly later.
* This file is called piggy.py and contains a class for instantiating Window objects. 
* The window1 object contains the functionality for screen 1 (see figure 3).
* A second instantiaion of the Window object can be easily adopted to accomidate screen2.

#### File: piggy.py and its corresponding console output

Figure 3. The Window class

* The class based window accepts and validates user input for the number of players and the names of each player.

* This step concludes basic programming for the View in MVC.

### Step 3.) Program the backend
- Remember to make the controller navigate to the 2nd window (not the 1st window)
